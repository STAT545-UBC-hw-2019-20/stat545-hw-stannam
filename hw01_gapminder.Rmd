<!-- TODO: more tinkering with the YAML header??? -->

```{r load, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```

# First things first: view the whole dataset

```{r whole data}
tibbleData <- tibble::as_tibble(gapminder)
DT::datatable(tibbleData)
```

# What I want to do

Investigate factors behind the different life expectancies using the contemporary data.

# Samples later than 2000

We are living in the 21st century. Why not give more weight on the contemporary data (from 2001)?
```{r contemporary data}
contempData <- gapminder[which(gapminder$year > 2000),]
```

# factors that influence Life Expectancy

## correlation between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy

...although it seems obvious that the rich lives longer.

Plot GDP on the y-axis and Life Expectancy on the x-axis:

```{r gdp-lifeexp, echo=FALSE}
plot(contempData$gdpPercap, contempData$lifeExp)
```

## correlation between population and Life Expectancy

Now it is less obvious but a research (Calhoun, J.B., 1973. Death squared: the explosive growth and demise of a mouse population. Proc. R. Soc. Med. 66, 80â€“88.) may indicate that larger population (higher population density, to be honest) has negative effect on the life expectancy

Plot population on the y-axis and Life Expectancy on the x-axis:

```{r pop-lifeexp, echo=FALSE}
plot(contempData$pop, contempData$lifeExp)
```

Messy.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
