## Myself

### Name(s)

My name is [Stanley Nam](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/person/stanley-nam/). I have another name too, because I was born and raised in Korea: 성현 [sʌŋ.jʌn]. Admittedly, it is difficult to pronounce it, so I just go by **Stanley**. FYI, speakers of Mandarin are welcome to pronounce the corresponding Chinese characters to my name: 成鉉.

* Stanley Nam

* 남성현 [nɑm.sʌŋ.jʌn]

* 南成鉉 Nán Chéngxuàn (in pinyin)

### What I do

I am a PhD student in [linguistics at UBC](https://linguistics.ubc.ca), and I study how people use speech sounds to communicate, especially in my native language, Korean. Although I have been using GitHub for my research assistantship, it is my first time to systematically learn how to use it (from writing readme.md)! So I am super excited about it. You may also find my footprints on the GitHub universe at [Phonological CorpusTools](https://github.com/PhonologicalCorpusTools/CorpusTools).

Other than linguistics, I swim. This term, I started swimming regularly at the UBC Aquatic Centre. I *try to* be there three or four times a week (which means I **try**). I hope it will help to have the *declaration* forever engraved here on readme.md.
